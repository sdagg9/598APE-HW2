# Peer Grading Instructions

We've given a script to help with running the benchmarks: `./benchmark <benchmark_name>`. This should create a subdirectory for each benchmark with compile and program output and perf.stat for that benchmark for perf metrics. If the script does not work, please run each benchmark on your own!

To run the following optimizations:
* baseline: Run from the `main` branch.
* OpenMP: Run from the `parallelization` branch.
* PolyDivMod: Run from the `poly_div_mod` branch.
* inverse multiplication instead of division: Run from the `inv_division` branch.
* Bithacks: Run from the `bithacks!` branch


# 598APE-HW2: Homomorphic Encryption

This is a C implementation of a SHE scheme based on the [Fan-Vercauteren](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144) RLWE-based approach and [toy implementations in Python](https://bit-ml.github.io/blog/post/homomorphic-encryption-toy-implementation-in-python/). Your task is to build and run it, then consider performance improvements.

Warning: This code is for instruction only. Do not use this implementation in any practical setting!

To compile the program run:
```bash
make -j
```

To clean existing build artifacts run:
```bash
make clean
```

Once built, run:
```bash
./main.exe  # A short demonstration
```

## Benchmarks

To build and run the benchmarks:

```bash
make bench_matmul.exe
./bench_matmul.exe 0 16  # 16x16 Ciphertext * Plaintext
./bench_matmul.exe 1 32  # 32x32 Ciphertext * Ciphertext

# Build and run B+W image converter benchmark
make bench_bw.exe
./bench_bw.exe inputs/bird.jpg

# Build and run Sobel filter benchmark
make bench_sobel.exe
./bench_sobel.exe inputs/bird.jpg
```

## Docker

For ease of use and installation, we provide a docker image capable of running and building code here. The source docker file is in /docker (which is essentially a list of commands to build an OS state from scratch). It contains the dependent compilers, and some other nice things.

You can build this yourself manually by running `cd docker && docker build -t <myusername>/598ape`. Alternatively we have pushed a pre-built version to `wsmoses/598ape` on Dockerhub.

You can then use the Docker container to build and run your code. If you run `./dockerrun.sh` you will enter an interactive bash session with all the packages from docker installed (that script by default uses `wsmoses/598ape`, feel free to replace it with whatever location you like if you built from scratch). The current directory (aka this folder) is mounted within `/host`. Any files you create on your personal machine will be available there, and anything you make in the container in that folder will be available on your personal machine.
